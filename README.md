This project analyzes the US National Crime Dataset from 1991 to 2020. The questions to be answered are:

Question 1: Has black hate crime violence gone down since 1991 or increased, assuming purely anti-black sentiment (ignoring just overtly racist people to many races)?

Question 2: Has COVID-19 had a significant impact on hate crime rates for Asian Americans, assuming purely anti-asian sentiment (ignoring just overtly racist people to many races)?
